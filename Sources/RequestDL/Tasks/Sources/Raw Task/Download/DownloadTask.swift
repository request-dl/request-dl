/**
 Performs a download request.

 You can use ``DownloadTask/result()`` function to receive the async bytes result of the request.

 In the example below, a request is made to the Apple's website:

 ```swift
 func makeRequest() async throws {
     let result = try await DownloadTask {
         BaseURL("apple.com")
     }
     .result()

     var data = Data()

     for try await bytes in result.payload {
         data.append(bytes)
     }

     print("Received data: \(data)")
 }
 ```

 It's possible to control the length of bytes read by using the ``ReadingMode`` property.

 ```swift
 func makeRequest() async throws {
     let result = try await DownloadTask {
         BaseURL("apple.com")
         ReadingMode(separator: "\n")
     }
     .result()

     var table = [Data]()

     for try await line in result.payload {
         table.append(line)
     }

     print("Received table of contents: \(table)")
 }
 ```

 > Note: The ``Property`` instance used by ``DownloadTask`` contains information about the request
 such as its URL, headers, body and etc.
