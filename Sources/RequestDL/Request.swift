/**
 The Request protocol is the basis of all other objects, with it we have the body property
 that uses the opaque `some Request` return type. In this case, we can create new
 objects by combining the use of others to configure several properties of a request at once.

 ```swift
 import RequestDL

 struct DefaultHeaders: Request {

     let cache: Bool

     var body: some Request {
         Headers.ContentType(.json)
         Headers.Accept(.json)

         if cache {
             Cache(.returnCacheDataElseLoad)
         }
     }
 }
 ```

 We can explore and use many different objects to meet some application business
 rule. An example where this approach is interesting is in the case of tokens that
 are stored in some data provider and we have to pass the request to have access
 to a certain feature of the backend API.

    /// The Request type representing the request body.
    associatedtype Body: Request

    /**
     Defines the properties of the request.

     When you implement a custom Request, you need to implement the body
     property to provide the request properties. Return a property by combining
     the Requests implemented by the RequestDL, as well as other Requests
     implemented by you.

     ```swift
     import RequestDL

     struct MyRequest: Request {

         var body: some Request {
             BaseURL("google.com")
         }
     }
     ```

    static func makeRequest(_ request: Self, _ context: Context) async
}

    public static func makeRequest(_ request: Self, _ context: Context) async {

            root: context.root,
            object: EmptyObject(request),
            children: []
        )

        let newContext = context.append(node)
        await Body.makeRequest(request.body, newContext)
    }
