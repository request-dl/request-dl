# Creating Requests from Scratch

RequestDL is a powerful Swift library designed according to the declarative programming paradigm, offering an extensive API for specifying the fields of a request. Whether it's an HTTP request or any other network operation, RequestDL simplifies the process by focusing on four key fields:

1. **URL**: Specify the target URL for your request, allowing you to connect to the desired endpoint.
2. **Method**: Define the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to determine the action to be performed on the server.
3. **Headers**: Add custom headers to your request, such as authentication tokens, content types, or any other metadata required for proper communication.
4. **Body**: Include the payload or data to be sent as part of your request, enabling you to transmit information or perform operations on the server.

With RequestDL's intuitive syntax and comprehensive API, you can effortlessly construct and send requests, making API interactions in your Swift projects more concise and declarative. Enjoy a streamlined approach to handling requests while focusing on the essential aspects of your application's networking needs.
